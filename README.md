Front-End Intern - Week 1: Personal Landing Page

 Project Overview
This project fulfills the Week 1 task for the Front-End Development Internship, creating a personal landing page titled "Welcome to Raja Awais fitness" from scratch.

Key Technical Details

 Semantic HTML: Utilized <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> for clear structure.
 Mobile-First Design: Base styles target small screens, and a media query adjusts the layout for desktop views (screens wider than 768px).
*   Layout Techniques:*
    Flexbox: Used in the header and .hero-section for alignment.
    CSS Grid: Used in the .feature-grid (desktop view) for a responsive 3-column layout.
 Custom CSS: No external CSS libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) were used, adhering to the "No CSS libraries allowed" rule.
 Sections Included: Hero, Feature, Contact Form (non-functional), and Footer (with mandatory disclaimer).

 Brand Rule
The footer includes the mandatory disclaimer: "Developed by Raja Awais".
